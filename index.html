                        <p class="text-white-50">Online shopping offers potentially limitless purchasing options. Customers enjoy the power to choose, but too many choices lead to indecision, lower satisfaction and fewer purchases. In a famous experiment, customers given many types of jam to choose from were much less likely to make a purchase than those given fewer choices. E-tailers like Amazon deal with this problem using recommender systems, which  Mckinsey and company estimate to account for 35% of their profit. Online grocery shopping is on the rise, with instacart seeing a 500% increase due to the pandemic (CNBC).</p>

This could serve as a period over which to send personalized coupons. It could also serve as a warning for when customers are less likely to come back at all. For example, if a customer hasnâ€™t returned in 10 days it might be worth exerting extra effort to get them to consider shopping with Instacart again.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Finally, I compared the number of times an item is reordered to the number of times an item is bought for the first time. I found that the majority of items purchased have been purchased before. This means that if customers purchase a new item as a result of a recommendation, that new purchase has the potential to be bought again in the future, boosting future profits.</p>

                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">I used LightFM to implement two recommender models. The first model only used collaborative filtering. This technique finds users that rate items similarly to suggest items that a given user has not tried. I used the number of purchases for a given item as a proxy for rating. The second model also used collaborative filtering in combination with content based filtering. Content based filtering finds items with similar features for recommendations. The features used were department and aisle. he collaborative filtering alone obtained a higher mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 across users as opposed to an AUC of 0.8, and so would be the more useful model for future use. AUC is a useful way to simultaneously account for both accuracy and precision of a classification model. This is important because we can obtain high accuracy by always recommending something that most users will want. This would completely discount the minority of false negatives, making churn more likely in a subgroup of shoppers.</p>
